  <p>We do not remain completely immobile during sleep. Some amount of movement, changing positions, and muscle twitch is normal.</p>
  <p>When limb (arm, leg) movements are frequent or severe enough, the condition is called periodic limb movement disorder or PLMD. Many people who have PLMD are not aware of it. In some people, PLMD disrupts sleep and causes a sleep debt. In other people, the PLMD is present but not severe enough to actually disrupt sleep.</p>
  <p>Another sleep-related movement disorder is called Restless Legs Syndrome or RLS. RLS is characterized by an oftentimes irresistible urge to move the legs. RLS symptoms are worse at night when the person is trying to rest - so people with RLS often have problems trying to fall asleep. For more information on RLS, go <a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/restless_legs/detail_restless_legs.htm">here</a></p>
