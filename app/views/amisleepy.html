  <p>The vast majority of us need 7-8 hours of sleep each 24-hour period to maintain optimal performance and alertness. A small percentage of us can maintain optimal performance and alertness on less than 7-8 hours, and some of us require more than 7-8 hours. Are you obtaining the amount of sleep that is optimal for you?</p>
