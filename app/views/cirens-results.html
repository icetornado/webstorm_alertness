  <p class="alert alert-success center-block text-center"><strong>Your CIRENS score is: {{chronoScore}}</strong></p>
  <p>Your CIRENS score is calculated by subtracting your answer to item #1 from your answer to item #2.</p>
  <p>CIRENS scores range from -4 to 4:</p>

  <p> Morning Energy Type - score of -4 to -2 <br>
    Neither Energy Type = score of -1 to +1 <br>
    Evening Energy Type = score of +2 to +4
  </p>
  <p>Your CIRENS score is generally related to your preferred bedtimes and wake-up times. For example, lower CIRENS scores often correlate with earlier preferred wake-up times, and higher CIRENS scores often correlate with later preferred wake-up times. Your CIRENS score may change (usually become lower or more morning-preferring) as you get older.</p>
