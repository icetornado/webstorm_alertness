  <p class="alert alert-success center-block text-center"><strong>Your CIRENS score is: {{chronoScore}}</strong></p>
  <p>Your CIRENS score is calculated by subtracting your answer to item #1 from your answer to item #2.</p>
  <p>CIRENS scores range from -4 to 4:</p>
  <ul class="glass-bg custom-bullet">
    <li style="font-size: 14px;"> Morning Energy Type = (-4) to (-2) </li>
    <li style="font-size: 14px;">Neither Energy Type = (-1) to (+1) </li>
    <li style="font-size: 14px;">Evening Energy Type =  (+2) to (+4)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your CIRENS score is generally related to your preferred bedtimes and wake-up times. For example, lower CIRENS scores often correlate with earlier preferred wake-up times, and higher CIRENS scores often correlate with later preferred wake-up times. Your CIRENS score may change (usually become lower or more morning-preferring) as you get older.</p>
