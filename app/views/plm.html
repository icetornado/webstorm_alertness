  <p>Many of us occasionally experience difficulty falling asleep (taking more than about 20 minutes to fall asleep) when we go to bed at night. We also can have frequent awakenings after we've fallen asleep (problems staying asleep). It is normal for these to occur occasionally - and it is normal to have problems sleeping during the day. When problems falling asleep or staying asleep at night are accompanied by daytime symptoms such as sleepiness, fatigue, or cognitive problems, they are called <strong>"insomnia."</strong></p>
  <p>Why are these problems important to address? The reason is because the more time we spend awake during our sleep period (trying to fall asleep or get back to sleep), the less actual sleep we obtain. We build up a sleep debt that impairs alertness, cognitive performance, mood, and other functions.</p>
  <p>The good news is that if addressed soon after they start (within days or weeks), problems falling asleep or staying asleep can be reduced by correcting sleep habits. In fact, poor sleep habits alone can cause problems falling asleep or staying asleep.</p>
  <p>This is where the <a href="#checklist">Healthy Sleep Checklist</a> becomes critical. If you are experiencing problems falling asleep or staying asleep, do not ignore them. Revisit all 10 steps of your Healthy Sleep Checklist, and start implementing #10 right away.</p>
  <p>And although it seems contrary to common sense, a first-line treatment for insomnia is mild sleep restriction. Reducing nightly time in bed and not napping during the day (or napping just enough to ensure safety) builds up a mild sleep debt that promotes sleep.</p>
