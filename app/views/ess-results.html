  <h4 class="row text-center fatigue-header">Results of ESS</h4>
<p><strong>Your ESS score is: N/A</strong></p>
<p>Your ESS score is calculated by adding up your responses to all 8 items. ESS scores range 0 to 24.</p>
<p><strong>ESS scores between 0 and 10:</strong> Scores in this range suggest that you do not have a problem with daytime sleepiness.</p>
<p><i>If you are getting 7-8 hours of sleep per night:</i> you are doing great. Keep getting at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night to maintain optimal alertness and mental acuity.</p>
<p><i>If you are getting less than 7-8 hours of sleep per night:</i> Even though your score on the ESS suggests that daytime sleepiness is not a problem for you, your mood, energy and physical health will benefit from increasing your nightly sleep toward the scientifically recommended 7-8 hours per night. Try increasing your sleep by 20 minutes, and see if some aspects of your well-being improve.</p>
<p><strong>ESS scores between 11 and 24:</strong> Scores in this range suggest that you are having difficulties staying awake under conditions when most other people can stay awake.</p>
<p><i>If you are not getting at least 7 hours of sleep per night:</i> increase your nightly sleep amount. The closer you can get to the scientifically recommended 7-8 hours per night, the more benefit you will obtain. Can you commit to obtaining 20-30 minutes more sleep per night for a trial period of a week or so? Give it a try and see whether you feel better and perform better.</p>
<p><i>If you are getting at least 7 hours of sleep:</i> something may be disrupting your sleep without your awareness. Go through the Health Sleep Checklist again to see if you overlooked something (for example, leaving the TV on while you are trying to sleep). You can also talk to your healthcare provider.</p>
