  <h4 class="row text-center header-bg">MEQ Types Additional Information</h4>
  <p>Results from early studies showed that MEQ scores correlate with body temperature and other biological rhythms. For example, Definite Morning Types (or "extreme morning types") show an earlier evening peak in body temperature -- and an earlier morning dip in body temperature -- compared to Definite Evening Types.</p>

  <p>Based on their preferred wake-up and bed times, we can predict that Definite Morning Types will find it difficult to stay awake and perform well during the midnight shift. In contrast, and based on their preferred wake-up and bed times, we can predict that Definite Evening Types will find it difficult to awaken and perform well on an early morning shift. There is some scientific support for these predictions. Effective fatigue countermeasures (including recuperative breaks and caffeine) become critical to performance maintenance under these circumstances.</p>
