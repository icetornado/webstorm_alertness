  <p>Snoring noises are caused by partial blockages to airflow in your throat or nose. Snoring sometimes bothers those around you more than it bothers YOU. After all, you are asleep and aren't aware of the snoring. So why be concerned?</p>
  <p>First, snoring can disrupt sleep - and reduce the overall amount of sleep you obtain. You build up a sleep debt that impairs alertness, cognitive performance, mood, and other functions.</p>
  <p>Second, snoring can be a symptom of a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea or OSA. OSA also disrupts sleep, causes a sleep debt, and leads to impaired waking function.</p>
  <p>Sleep specialists sometimes use a tool called the STOP-BANG, as a first- screen for OSA. STOP-BANG is short for the 8 assessment factors comprising the tool: <strong><u>S</u></strong>noring, <strong><u>T</u></strong>ired during the day, <strong><u>O</u></strong>bserved gasping or stopping breathing during sleep by others, high blood <strong><u>P</u></strong>ressure, <strong><u>B</u></strong>ody mass index (BMI) above a certain value, <strong><u>A</u></strong>ge = older than 50, large <strong><u>N</u></strong>eck size, and male <strong><u>G</u></strong>ender - however, women (especially post-menopausal) also can snore and have OSA.
